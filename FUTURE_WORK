If we convert to using SystemJS, we could replace the entire Locator framework with:

* Classes at use site.
* Mock injection per https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/issues/798 or
  https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/issues/736#issuecomment-137699003

Among other things, this would simplify much of the architecture from the
perspective of determining when different components were used (i.e. the
distinction between describe-time and use-time -- I now discover that there's
also a difference between local and over-wire uses.)
